- documentation!
  - "Getting Started"
  - "troubleshooting" aka "aaaaah, it's not working!"
  - API documentation -> if it isn't documented, it doesn't exist ;-)

- errors: use general __repr__ format for all exceptions; don't check if lineno
  is given or not!

- each syntax element must have a lineno property! -> REALLY?
